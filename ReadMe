Who are your team members? Names & surnames. Jenny Wirries and Jaiden Nicholson
What are the modifications you made to the game? We added a speed boost to the game, while also adding a short recharge time period after every single use. There is a lemon icon on the screen to show whether the boost is active or not.
What's the biggest challenge you have so far? My biggest challenge was trying to figure out how to connect the speed to the shift button.
Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later? No this is final version of this assignment. If there were changes we wanted to implement would maybe be a UI for the game.
